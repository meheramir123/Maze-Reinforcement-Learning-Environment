# Maze-Reinforcement-Learning-Environment
A custom maze environment built with **Gymnasium** and **Pygame**, designed to train reinforcement learning agents using **Stable-Baselines3 (PPO)**.

# What's in This Maze?
This isn't just any maze—it's full of surprises! Your agent has to figure out how to survive and win by learning the right moves.

    -Death Pits — Fall in... and it's instant game over with a big penalty. Stay sharp!
    -Bombs — Step on one, and BOOM—game over with a heavy penalty.
    -Rewards — Shiny bonuses scattered around the maze. Grab them for extra points!
    -Goal — The ultimate destination. Reach it to finish the game and earn a massive reward!

Your agent’s mission: Navigate the maze, collect rewards, dodge deadly traps, and make it safely to the goal.


    -Custom 5x5 Maze Grid — A compact but tricky challenge.
    -Interactive Elements — Death pits, bombs, rewards, and a goal to make learning meaningful.
    -Easy RL Integration — Fully compatible with stable-baselines3. Plug and play with PPO, DQN, A2C, and more!
    -Visual Fun with Pygame — Watch your agent learn and move in a neat graphical interface.
    -Train, Test, Repeat — Seamlessly switch between training and testing your agent.
